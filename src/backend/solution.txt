To solve the problem, we start by letting the lengths of the three pieces of string be represented in terms of a variable \( x \).

Given the ratio of the pieces is \( 2 : 4 : 7 \), we can express the lengths as follows:

- Shortest piece: \( 2x \)
- Middle piece: \( 4x \)
- Longest piece: \( 7x \)

According to the problem, the longest piece is 40 cm longer than the shortest piece. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
7x = 2x + 40
\]

Now, we can solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:

\[
7x - 2x = 40
\]

\[
5x = 40
\]

2. Divide both sides by 5:

\[
x = 8
\]

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the lengths of each piece:

- Shortest piece: \( 2x = 2(8) = 16 \) cm
- Middle piece: \( 4x = 4(8) = 32 \) cm
- Longest piece: \( 7x = 7(8) = 56 \) cm

Finally, we find the original length of the string by adding all three pieces together:

\[
16 + 32 + 56 = 104 	ext{ cm}
\]

Thus, the original length of the piece of string is:

\[
	ext{Answer: } 104 	ext{ cm}
\]
